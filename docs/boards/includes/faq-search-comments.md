### Q: How do I search for entries made in the Discussion field? 

**A:** You can search a list of work items for keywords entered into the Discussion field. Add the **History** field as a clause, use the **Contains Words** operator, and then enter the keyword or phrase for the **Value**. 

To search for comments made to backlog work items, you can quickly create a query from your backlog, and then modify the query by adding the **History** clause.
