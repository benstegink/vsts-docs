# Buy and manage CI/CD for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

Learn how to buy self-hosted or Microsoft-hosted CI/CD and change your paid Azure Pipelines capacity.

With Azure Pipelines, you can run builds and deploy releases by using the Microsoft-hosted agents, your own machines, or both.
We offer a *free tier* for each. The *free tier* includes:

- Free tier of Microsoft-hosted CI/CD (one concurrent job, up to 30 hours per month)
- One self-hosted CI/CD concurrent job

[!INCLUDE [pricing-calculator-tip](../../includes/pricing-calculator-tip.md)]

## Microsoft-hosted CI/CD

Each organization begins with the *free tier* of Microsoft-hosted CI/CD. This tier provides the ability to run one parallel build or release job, for up to 30 hours per month. Switch to paid Microsoft-hosted CI/CD if you need more than 30 hours per month, or to run multiple jobs simultaneously.

When you pay per parallel job, there's no monthly time limit for your builds and releases. The maximum runtime for a single job increases from 60 minutes to 6 hours. With Microsoft-hosted CI/CD, the price includes all infrastructure that Microsoft runs (virtual machines, databases, storage, and egress) to deliver this service.

> [!NOTE]
> When you purchase your first Microsoft-hosted parallel job, the number of parallel jobs you have in the organization still stays at one. This purchase only removes the limits on the free parallel job that you have. To run two jobs concurrently, you need to purchase two parallel jobs.

Pipelines in a [public project](../public/about-public-projects.md) can run up to 10 free parallel jobs with unlimited minutes on Microsoft-hosted agents.

## Self-hosted CI/CD

Azure Pipelines also offers you a way to run the agent on machines that you manage, whether your machines are on-premises or in the cloud. Typically, you'll choose this option in either of the following situations:

* Custom software that runs in your build process isn't included in the Microsoft-hosted option.
* You already have an Azure DevOps Server build server running, and you aren't ready to move your build definitions to Azure Pipelines.

### Self-hosted public projects

For pipelines in a [public project](../public/about-public-projects.md), you can run as many parallel jobs with self-hosted agents as you require.

### Self-hosted private projects

The *free tier* is one parallel job. You also get one free parallel job for each Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber who's a member of your organization. You can get more using paid self-hosted parallel jobs.
