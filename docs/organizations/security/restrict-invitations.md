# Restrict new user invitations from Project and Team Administrators 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

By default, all administrators can invite new users to their Azure DevOps organization. Disabling this policy will block Team and Project Administrators from inviting new users to the organization. Project Collection Administrators (PCAs) can add new users to the organization, regardless of the policy status. If a user is already a member of the organization, Project and Team Adminstrators will still be able to add that user to their project.

|Team Administrators|can add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team | **cannot** add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team        |
